# Snake-Water-Gun-game

Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python)

This project is a simple Python-based game where the user plays against the computer. The program randomly selects one of three options: snake, water or gun. The user inputs their choice, and the game compares both selections to determine the winner.

The logic is implemented using numeric mappings for each choice, along with conditional checks to decide whether the result is a win, loss or draw. The project demonstrates the use of basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, conditionals, user input handling and the random module.
